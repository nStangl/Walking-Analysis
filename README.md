# Human Gait Analysis with Abnormality Detection with 4D Humans

# Repo Overview

This repo is a fork of [4D-Humans](https://github.com/shubham-goel/4D-Humans) and uses 4D Humans and it's underlying models for tracking and recognizing individuals to then analyze their walking gait for indications of abnormality, instability and higher risk of falling.
